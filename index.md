## Study description

Currently, Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) can be accessed not only on desktop/laptop computers but also on mobile devices. Participants of the study will be asked to fill out questionnaires and to learn mini-MOOCs with a mobile phone while sitting in the lab and while walking through the campus to a preset destination and back.

## Instructions
1. Before the study participants will be asked to fill out a questionnaire about their previous experience on MOOC learning and mobile learning.
2. Then participants will be assigned to perform two learning tasks – one to perform in the lab while sitting, and the other while walking outside.
3. After each learning task participants are asked to fill out a questionnaire about the particular learning task.
4. During the learning task, participants will use a mobile phone (a smartphone) to learn mini-MOOCs.

## Participant requirements
* Participants should be able to use a mobile phone for watching videos and reading the text while walking.
* Participants are advised to bring their own headphones with a 3.5mm plug.
