## Study description

Currently, Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) can be accessed on not only desktop/laptop computers but also mobile devices. This study mainly focuses on understanding the impact of learning on-the-go in mobile MOOC learning. Participants will be asked to do questionnaires and to learn mini MOOCs with a mobile phone while sitting in the lab or walking to a supermarket.

## Instructions
1. Before the study, the participant will be asked to fill a questionnaire about the previous experience on MOOC learning and mobile learning.
2. Then the participants will be assigned two learning tasks under different conditions (i.e. learning in the lab and learning while walking) in random order.
3. Before and after each learning task, there will be questionnaires about the pre/post-knowledge and perceptions.
4. During the learning task, the participant will use a mobile device (provided by researchers) to learn mini MOOCs while sitting in the lab or walking to a supermarket.

## Participant requirements
* Participants should be able to use a mobile phone for watching videos and reading the text while walking.
